Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg along with his college roommates in 2004. Initially created as a social networking site for Harvard students, Facebook rapidly expanded to become a global social media giant.

Over the years, Meta has acquired several other social media platforms and technology companies, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, significantly expanding its influence in the tech industry. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta continues to lead in social media innovation and virtual reality technology.
